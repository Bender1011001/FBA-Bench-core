# ARXIV PLACEHOLDER â€” SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
# The literal token "ARXIV_ID" is used across the repository until the real arXiv ID is assigned.
# Once available (e.g., 2501.01234), perform a repo-wide replacement of "ARXIV_ID" with the real ID.
# Recommended commands:
#   POSIX (macOS/Linux):
#     git grep -l 'ARXIV_ID' | xargs -I{} sed -i'' -e 's/ARXIV_ID/2501.01234/g' {}
#   Windows PowerShell:
#     git grep -l 'ARXIV_ID' | % { (Get-Content $_) -replace 'ARXIV_ID','2501.01234' | Set-Content $_ }
# After replacement, re-run validation and CI to ensure links and citations render correctly.
