# Rescue Log

## 2025-10-05 – Phase 2 Demolition

- Timestamp (UTC): 2025-10-05T11:17Z
- Branch: rescue/core-rebuild is checked out and synced (no new commits fetched)
- Inventory: [`docs/legacy_src_inventory.txt`](docs/legacy_src_inventory.txt:1) was generated prior to demolition and contains 202 entries
- Action: The entire legacy `src/` directory was removed
- New skeleton: Created skeleton directories and placeholder files (11 files across 5 subdirectories)
- Placeholders: Added placeholder content (docstrings, `__all__`, `pass` statements) to keep imports and linting functional
- Next phases: Placeholder implementations will be filled in Phases 3–7
