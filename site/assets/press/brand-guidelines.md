# FBA-Bench Brand Guidelines

## Introduction
These guidelines ensure consistent use of the FBA-Bench brand across all materials, maintaining professionalism and clarity in communicating our AI benchmarking mission.

## Logo Usage
- **Clear Space**: Maintain at least 20px (or logo height) around the logo on all sides.
- **Minimum Size**: 100px width for print/digital; do not scale below 50px for favicons.
- **Do Not**: Stretch, recolor (except light/dark variants), or add effects like shadows unless specified.
- Variants: Use `logo-light.svg` for dark backgrounds, `logo-dark.svg` for light (TODO: create dark variant).
- Fallback: `logo.png` for environments without SVG support.

## Color Usage
Refer to [brand-colors.md](brand-colors.md) for the palette.
- Primary use: FBA Blue (#61dafb) for calls-to-action and accents.
- Backgrounds: Dark theme (#0b0e14) for technical/docs sites.
- Ensure accessibility: Test contrast ratios.

## Typography
See [brand-typography.md](brand-typography.md) for details.
- Use system fonts for broad compatibility.
- Hierarchy: Clear headings with ample spacing.

## Imagery and Graphics
- Style: Clean, modern, tech-focused. Avoid stock photos; prefer diagrams, charts, abstract AI visuals.
- OG Images: Use `og-image.png` template (1200x630); customize with event-specific text.
- Charts: Consistent colors from palette; label axes clearly.

## Voice and Tone
- Professional yet approachable: Explain complex AI concepts simply.
- Inclusive: Use gender-neutral language; focus on impact.
- Key Messages: "Reproducible benchmarks for trustworthy AI agents in e-commerce."

## Dos and Don'ts
- **Do**: Align with open-source ethos; credit contributors.
- **Don't**: Use brand for commercial endorsement without permission.
